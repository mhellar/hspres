                    So at this point we had tackled a number of barriers. The question now was how to give easy access to the curators in a standardized way across institutions. So we built a linux based server together that ran the emulator in a web-browser. Each institution
                    worked with IT to deploy this server on their local network. The curators simply had to go to a url, login and load the files in photoshop 1. We did write a manual on the basics of photoshop 1. We also had a standard numbering system
                    for the disk images indexed in a spreadsheet so that notes could be compared across institutions.

                    and writings associated with his office have been influential in the acceptance and use of advanced materials and technologies for design and fabrication.<br><br> For Biennale Interieur 2012 he created a prototype
                    for a motorised compact-living cocoon that rotates to provide space for relaxing, sleeping and bathing <br><br> This brings a new layer of enthusiasm and activity to the typical home, similar to that of an exercise machine or hamster

                    proposes a new typology which was once sedentary, into one based on movement and interaction.

                    RV Prototype House is a 1/5th scale model of a house that increases living space by rotating in two axes on a robotic base. In addition to a floor in one orientation, one wall and the ceiling surface can be rotated as new floors. 150m of living surface
                    is realized within a 60m footprint. Made of a lightweight cored carbon fiber fabric the entire shell weighs less than 50 kilos allowing it to rotate freely.

                    OSC stands for Open Sound Control, It was developed and the Center for New Music and Technology at U.C. Berkeley. It is a fast networked data protocol and it was wonderful to see it used here. The tablet app would send OSC data to a client written in
                    an language called python on a laptop included with the work which wouls the pass the command onto the stepper motor driversIt's also interesting me to consider the documentation of the protocols of that are used in these systems in
                    addition to the code and components because it is how the system communicates.

                <aside class="notes">
                    Lovers is an immersive, room-sized multimedia installation by Japanese artist Teiji Furuhashi (1960–1995). Life-sized images of the artist and other fellow members of the Kyoto-based artist collective Dumb Type are projected onto the walls of a darkened
                    room from a tower of computer-controlled video and slide projectors at its center. The figures move like specters around the perimeter of the space, in a looped choreographic sequence made variable by a visitor-activated motion sensor,
                    which intervenes to restart one of the projections when triggered. Confined to their autonomous projections, these eponymous “lovers” overlap at moments within the sequence, whether running past each other or pausing in a gesture of
                    embrace, yet their bodies never make contact. Made just one year before Furuhashi’s death from AIDS-related illness, Lovers speaks to what the artist has described as “the theme of contemporary love in an ultra-romantic way.” Presented
                    for the first time since its inaugural exhibition at MoMA in 1995, the installation showcases the results of an extensive conservation effort recently completed by the Museum’s media conservators.

                    served the public facing interface, and another that facilitated the dialog between the user and an AI interpreter.

                    The XML dialect called AIML was developed by Dr Richard Wallace and a worldwide free software community. AIML formed the basis for what was a bot called "A.L.I.C.E.." ("Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity"), which won the annual Loebner Prize
                    Competition in Artificial Intelligence three times. It was in this language that you could craft an AI bot in and that is what rubys personality was created in.
