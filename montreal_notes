Argent Ruby was the first work I worked on for SFMoMA in 2009. I presented on the work here at the DOCAM summit in 2010. And I am happy to gieve an pdate on the work 6 years later.

In 2001–2 SFMOMA commissioned the web project Agent Ruby (agentruby.sfmoma.org/) by acclaimed San Francisco artist Lynn Hershman Leeson for its pioneering online platform e.space.

Agent Ruby was conceived as an “e-dream portal,” a new experience in expanded cinema originating from the character Ruby (played by Tilda Swinton) in Hershman Leeson’s 2002 feature film Teknolust.

The Agent Ruby web avatar is a multimedia interface which facilitates a dialog with the user.  The avatar passes input to an artificially intelligent natural language processing software.  

The AI software analyzes the input against a database(ruby’s Brain) for possible answers and returns a response. 

ProgramD is a fully functional AIML bot engine that was implemented in the Java Programming Language. While the code for Program-D is still available and compiles, no major updates including maintenance realease have been made

The piece reflects the artist’s long-standing interest in the interaction of fictional and virtual characters with real people and situations. 


Greg Lynn is an  innovator in redefining the medium of design with digital technology as well as pioneering the fabrication and manufacture of complex functional and ergonomic forms using technologies such as CNC machinery. 

Originally designed for the BIENNALE INTERIEUR 2012 as a response to a small domestic space, this rolling living unit packs 1500 square feet of living surface across 270 degrees of a rotating shell that occupies a maximum of 600 square feet in ground area. The furniture is gimbaled and designed so as to disappear into the surface revealing glowing translucent lanterns.

The RV prototype came as a 1/5 scale model and a 1/20 scale model.
